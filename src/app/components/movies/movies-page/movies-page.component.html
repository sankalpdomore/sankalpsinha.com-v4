            Movies, TV shows, and documentories, have always been a doorway to creative thinking for me. Seeing how directors & artists<br>around the world can perceive something so differently and creatively has always been inspiring for me as a creator. That's why I love watching movies, TV shows, or any other kind of media. This page is an attempt to capture everything I've watched so far.
