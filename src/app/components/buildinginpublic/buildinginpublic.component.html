                What Building in Public mean?
            </h3>
            <div class="common-body-text-16-regular">
                When you start a project, say building a car, manufacturing a sofa, designing a smartphone, or something
                creative like a painting or writing a book, you can choose to do these project in two ways.
            </div>
            <div class="common-body-text-18-bold">
                Building in Private:
            </div>
            <div class="common-body-text-16-regular">
                One way is to build in private where you design and assemble the said car, sofa, or smartphone in a
                closed garage or factory, hidden away from the general public, and then launch it in a big event. The
                same goes for the painting or a book for example. You paint or write this book without letting anyone
                know. You just involve a few people in the process to take feedback, tweak, and then display the
                painting one fine day or publish that book globally.
            </div>
            <div class="common-body-text-18-bold">
                Building in Public:
            </div>
            <div class="common-body-text-16-regular">
                The second way is to build in public. It's opposite to building in private. Here, instead of hiding your
                project, the process, the thinking, and other important details, you share these details in public. So
                in the context of building the car in public, you'll share your sketches, early 3D renderings, the
                thought behind the mechanics and design of the car, the materials you're using to build the car, the
                paint, any issues that you might come across building this car, so on and so forth.
                You'll share important details throughout the process of building this car with the public, via a blog
                post, a podcast, a YouTube channel or just getting covered by your local newspaper. But one thing is for
                sure, whatever you do, you'll remain open about sharing information about the project from start to
                finish, and sometimes even after.

                Early in my career, one thing I realized about myself is that I get motivated to work on things if I
                start sharing its progress in public. I've shared my To-Dos a lot in the past. I've shared about my
                side-projects in the past. I share my WIP design shots on Dribbble.

                </div>
                When you talk about your work in public it does a couple of things:
            </div>
            <div class="common-body-text-16-regular">
                <ol class="common-body-text-list">
                    <li>
                        <span class="common-body-text-16-bold">Social accountability:</span> The biggest one is that you
                        consciously start holding yourself accountable in public. Now that you've announced you're doing
                        that project, you know that people will know if you failed or succeeded in that project. And no
                        one likes to get embarrassed by their failure in public, so the ball gets rolling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="common-body-text-16-bold">Bias towards action:</span> Since you've announced the
                        start of the project in public (and given you want to share progress about it too), the task of
                        getting things done gets fuelled by both intrinsic (i.e. you want to work on this project) and
                        extrinsic (people might be interested in knowing the progress) motivations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="common-body-text-16-bold">Project documentation:</span> Another best part of
                        building in public is the documentation you get while talking about your project. Even if you
                        failed or had an okay-ish success in completing the project, you always have a written log of
                        your journey and those can be a huge asset either as a reference for future projects for
                        yourself or helping someone get started or figure out problems that you faced - by publishing
                        the process in a blog post or an e-book. <i><b>Process documentation is very underrated.</b></i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="common-body-text-16-bold">Attract collaborators, customers, patrons:</span> People
                        love listening to a story or seeing others do interesting stuff. Building in public might
                        attract (and have attracted) potential collaborators, customers, or patrons for your project. As
                        you talk about your progress in public, people see you as a doer + it builds credibility, which
                        in turn gives them the confidence to reach out for help, buy your product or just follow your
                        social account for future updates. It's a win-win.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="common-body-text-16-bold">Multi-day marketing vs. a single launch day:</span> The
                        biggest problem with building in private is spending a ton of effort, money and other resources
                        on the launch day i.e. to spread the word. Guess what?! Building in public helps you do that
                        from day 1. Think of your project being launched every day with every little update you share in
                        public. So instead of a "one-day mega-launch", it becomes a "multi-day micro-launch". This way,
                        more and more people will get to learn about your project every day rather than relying on one
                        single day.

                How I am going to make & publish this re-design project?
            </h3>
            <div class="common-body-text-16-regular">
                To start with, I want to stick with the concept of "incrementally correct personal website". I came
                across that concept from <a class="links-muted"
                    href="https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websites">Brian's blog</a> who
                got the idea from <a class="links-muted" href="https://designdetails.fm/episodes/113490">Guillermo
                    Rauch</a>. The concept is: <i class="qouting">"Building an incrementally correct product is the
                    process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or interesting. The faster
                    we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but tomorrow
                    things can be slightly closer to perfect."</i>
                <p></p>
                Why you may ask? It's because designing and building a portfolio website is an iterative process and if
                I start tweaking stuff to perfection, I'll launch slowly. If I launch slowly, I'll document and talk
                about my project less, which starts taking the route of "building in private".
                <p></p>
                So, simple to-dos to make sure I stay on track in designing and building my portfolio website in public
                can be:
