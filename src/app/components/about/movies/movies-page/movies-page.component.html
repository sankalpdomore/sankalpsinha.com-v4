            Since the day I got a camera phone, I was hooked on to clicking pictures. With better camera phones and photo sharing<br>apps like Instagram, I shared more pictures. But, lately, Instagram doesn't feel like a place to share photos anymore. It feels more<br>like an app to create dance and entertainment videos and reach more dopamine addicted users. This page is my reaction to the<br>disappointment Instagram has become. I love clicking pictures and sharing them, and finally, I have a place for them here. ðŸ™Œ
